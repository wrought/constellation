      <h1>Star Charts and Constellations</h1>

<p>Who can walk outside on a clear night in the countryside, and not look up
at the stars. Identifying constellations is one of the first lessons in
astronomy and ties together science and mythology. There are numerous
applications that present star maps to help stargazers identify the stars and
constellations they look at. In this assignment, students use data from
published star catalogs to create a star map picture, and draw constellations
on the star map. The shapes of the constellations come from the well-know book
by H. A. Rey, <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Stars-New-Way-See-Them/dp/0395248302"
title="Amazon.com: The Stars: A New Way to See Them: H. A. Rey: Books"><i>The
Stars: A New Way to See Them</a></i>. This was one of my favorite books as a
kid, and although I never followed up on my original dream to become an
astronomer, I spent many hours learning to find constellations in the northern
sky.</p>

<p>In addition to using an attractive domain, this assignment is nifty because
students manipulate real data. Students find assignments that use real data
compelling, because such assignments allow students to see that they are
taking steps toward writing "real" programs. The graphical nature of this
assignment is also appealing, and yet the underlying data structures and
algorithms involved in creating a star map are simple enough for CS1 students
to grasp.</p>

<h2><a href="./starmap.html">Assignment Handout</a></h2>

<p>Our CS1 course is taught using Python and uses a <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/pygraphics/" title="pygraphics - Google
Code">locally modified picture library</a> derived from Mark Guzdial's <a
href="http://amazon.com/dp/0131176552" title="Amazon.com: Introduction to
Computing and Programming in Python, A Multimedia Approach: Mark Guzdial:
Books">Introduction to computing and programming with Python: A Multimedia
Approach</a>. The <a href="./starmap.html">assignment handout</a> describes the
assignment that our CS1 students were asked to complete. There are lots of
possible variations. </p>

<p>The assignment was designed for a Python course, so the assignment handout
	is specific to Python, but a Java solution is available to instructors on
	request.</p>

<h2>Data collection</h2>

<p>The biggest challenge in designing this assignment was finding appropriate
data sources. Following is a brief description of the data sources and the
steps involved to produce the data given to the students.</p>

<p>The star data comes from the <a href="http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/"
title="VizieR Service">VizieR Catalog Service</a>. I used data from two
catalogs: IV/22 K5 - SAO - HD - Common Name Cross Index (Smith 1996), and
IV/27 HD-DM-GC-HR-HIP-Bayer-Flamsteed Cross Index (Kostjuk, 2002). The first
contained names, while the second contained the Harvard Revised number which
was used to identify stars that belonged to the various constellations. </p>

<p>To convert the star positions defined by Right Ascension and Declination
into x, y, and z coordinates, I used a command-line tool from the <a
href="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools.html" title="WCSTools:
Image World Coordinate System Utilities">WCSTools</a> package called <a
href="http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/skycoor.html"
title="WCSTools skycoor Sky Coordinate Conversion Utility">skycoor</a>.</p>

<p>The constellation data was also drawn from two sources. The stellar data
comes from a <a href="http://seds.org/Maps/Const/constS.html">collection</a>
of webpages that describe 88 constellations. The stellar data was used to
associate star names with the Harvard Revised number in the original data set.
The data that defines the lines that make up a constellation picture were
taken from a <a
href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellationjavalist.html"
title="Interactive Sky Chart List">java applet</a> by <a
href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/" title="Chris Dolan's Home Page">Chris
Dolan</a>. One of the data files provided with the applet (starname_rey.dat)
contains the data to draw the constellations as drawn by H.A.Rey, author of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Stars-New-Way-See-Them/dp/0395248302"
