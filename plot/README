star plot

Based on assignment from Karen Reid at University of Toronto in 2009.

A copy of the assignment is provided as starmap.html

The star data is stored in stars.txt and is specified as follows:

    The first three fields are the x, y and z coordinates for the star.
        We will ignore the z coordinate, and use only the x and y coordinates.
        Each axis in the coordinate system goes from -1 to +1, and the centre point is 0,0. (See the figure below.)
    The fourth field is the Henry Draper number, which is simply a unique identifier for the star.
    The fifth field is the magnitude (or brightness) of the star.
    The sixth field is Harvard Revised number, another identifier.
    The seventh field exists only for a small number of stars and is a semicolon-separated list of names for a star. A star may have several names.
